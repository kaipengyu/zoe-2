## Room-by-Room Energy Saving Guide

### Your Family Room - The hangout zone
**Description:** It's where relaxation rules, but energy use can sneak up on you if you're not careful.

#### Energy Saving Tips:
1. **Give your vents some breathing room**
   - If furniture or curtains are blocking your HVAC vents, your system has to work harder, and that means wasted energy.

2. **Seal your leaks**
   - Drafts around windows and doors can drive up your energy bill.

3. **Get help from the sunshine (or shade)**
   - On warm days, close your curtains during the day to keep out the sun's warmth. On cold days, open them.

4. **Power down after you log off**
   - When you're not using your computer or other electronics, turn them off.

5. **Stream the smart way**
   - Watching your shows on a game console uses up to 10 times more energy than a laptop or tablet.*

6. **Try power management**
   - Get instant rebates on [advanced power strips](https://secure.delmarva.com/marketplace/category/dpl_advanced_power_solutions) to keep your electronics from pulling energy when you're not using them.

7. **Employ a temperature expert**
   - [Grab up to $100 in rebates](https://homeenergysavings.delmarva.com/md/residential/appliance-rebate-program/overview/smart-thermostats) on smart thermostats, which can learn your habits, optimize heating and cooling, and make adjustments automatically—even when you're not there.

### Your Kitchen - The heart of your home
**Description:** It's where the family tends to gather, along with lots of energy use, from the refrigerator to the dishwasher.

#### Energy Saving Tips:
1. **Give your refrigerator some love**
   - Every few months, vacuum the dust off your refrigerator's condenser coils. (They're usually hiding on the back or underneath.)

2. **Seal your refrigerator**
   - Open the door and check the rubber gaskets. If they're cracked or not sealing tightly, cold air could be sneaking out.

3. **Wait for a full load of dishes**
   - Running your dishwasher half-full? Hold off until it's packed so it can do its thing all at once.

4. **Call in the energy experts**
   - Request a [Quick Home Energy Check-up](https://homeenergysavings.delmarva.com/md/residential/quick-home-energy-check-up-program), and you'll get a custom energy efficiency report and maybe some no-cost products, too.

### Your Laundry Room - Where socks go to disappear
**Description:** It's where the laundry gets done, but a few smart moves here can clean up your energy use, too.

#### Energy Saving Tips:
1. **Don't over-dry your clothes**
   - If your dryer has a moisture sensor, use it! It'll stop the cycle when things are dry.

2. **Clean the lint trap**
   - It helps your dryer run more efficiently and reduces the risk of a fire. Win-win.

3. **Full loads = full savings**
   - Try to dry full loads of laundry, but if you must run a partial one, reduce the drying time.

4. **Manage your energy with efficient appliances**
   - [Instant discounts of $100 on ENERGY STAR® certified clothes washers](https://homeenergysavings.delmarva.com/md/residential/appliance-rebate-program/washers-discounts) can make it easier.

### Your Garage - The overflow zone
**Description:** It's where tools, gear, and even an extra refrigerator live, but it's also a space where energy efficiency can easily be overlooked.

#### Energy Saving Tips:
1. **Keep that overhead garage door closed**
   - Shutting it helps keep the heat or cold from sneaking into your home.

2. **Skip the garage refrigerator**
   - Got an extra refrigerator out there? It might be working overtime in the summer.

3. **Even better, recycle it**
   - Speaking of which, that outdated freezer or second refrigerator could cost you $80 or more every year to run.† The good news? [Recycling it is easy](https://homeenergysavings.delmarva.com/md/residential/appliance-recycling-program).

### Your Basement - Behind-the-scenes HQ
**Description:** It's where your furnace and water heater quietly do their thing, which makes it a hidden hot spot for energy savings.

#### Energy Saving Tips:
1. **Check your furnace filter monthly**
   - A dirty filter makes your heating system work harder than it should.

2. **Turn down the water heater**
   - Setting your water heater to 120 degrees Fahrenheit should be hot enough for showers and washing.

3. **Time to replace your water heater?**
   - It's easy with [$1,600 rebates on ENERGY STAR certified heat pump water heaters](https://homeenergysavings.delmarva.com/md/residential/appliance-rebate-program).

4. **Is your HVAC system struggling to keep up?**
   - That could mean higher costs. [A no-cost HVAC tune-up](https://homeenergysavings.delmarva.com/md/residential/hvac-efficiency-program/overview) can have your system running smoothly in no time.
